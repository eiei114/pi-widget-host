# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this Pi package.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run ci
```

## Local Pi testing

```bash
pi -e .
```

## Pull requests

Before opening a PR:

- Run `npm run ci`
- Update docs when behavior changes
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes
- Keep package contents small and intentional

## Release

Releases use npm Trusted Publishing. Do not add `NPM_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets.

On `main`, `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` creates the `v<version>` tag and GitHub Release after a `package.json` version bump, then dispatches `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.

```bash
npm version patch
git push
```

See [`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md) for the full Trusted Publishing workflow.
